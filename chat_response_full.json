  "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, this repository appears to contain the components necessary for retrieving, processing, and serving customs exchange rate data.\n\nThe core purpose is to acquire exchange rates from an external source (Amber Road), persist this data, and make it available for consumption, specifically for customs clearance calculations.\n\nThe repository exhibits a modular architecture, likely adhering to microservice principles, broken down into at least three distinct components:\n\n1.  **`logistics.trade-gie-trade-content-exchange-rates-retriever`**: This module is responsible for integrating with the external data source (Amber Road) to retrieve the raw exchange rate data. Document [4] explicitly states its role in retrieving data and storing it into DynamoDB, although the intermediate storage mechanism (potentially S3 based on the processor tests) is not fully detailed.\n2.  **`logistics.trade-exchange-rate-ingestion-processor`**: This component handles the processing of the retrieved exchange rate data. While the exact source it reads from is not fully specified by the READMEs, the test file `test_handler_read_from_s3` (Document [10]) suggests it may read data staged in S3, likely placed there by the Retriever. Its ultimate goal, in conjunction with the Retriever, is to store the processed data into DynamoDB for consumption (Document [4]).\n3.  **`logistics.trade-currency_exchange_rate_api`**: This module provides an API interface for consumers to query the stored exchange rate data. Document [9] details a `/exchangerate/v1/query` POST endpoint defined using OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger), which accepts requests specifying `fromCurrencyCode` and `toCurrencyCode` (Document [7]). This API layer abstracts the data storage details and provides a structured way for other systems to access the required exchange rates.\n\nThe overall data flow appears to be a pipeline: **Amber Road (Source) -> Retriever -> (Intermediate Storage, e.g., S3) -> Ingestion Processor -> DynamoDB (Persistence) -> Exchange Rate API (Consumption)**.\n\nKey design principles and practices evident include:\n*   **Modularity:** Separation of concerns into distinct retriever, processor, and API components.\n*   **Data Persistence:** Utilization of DynamoDB as the primary data store for processed exchange rates (Document [4]).\n*   **API-driven Access:** Providing data access via a well-defined REST API (Documents [7], [9]).\n*   **Automated Development Practices:** Use of `make` for environment setup and testing (Documents [1], [2], [3]), integration of code quality tools like `black` (formatter) and `flake8` (linter), and automated testing via `pytest` (Documents [1], [2], [3], [10]).\n*   **Deployment Automation:** Links to Jenkins pipelines indicate automated build and deployment processes (Documents [6], [8]).",
